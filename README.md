# RightWhaleRecognition

## Preprocessing
- readData.m : the first file to read images according to train.csv and categorized images into different subfolders according to labels.

### For recognition

- gTruth.mat: ROIs generated by image labeler.

- crop.m : load 'gTruth.mat', change path, and crop whale head according to ROI.

- divide_n_oversampling.m: 
  1. divide dataSet into testSet, sub_validationSet, sub_trainSet 
  2. oversampling by creating 9 copies of each image in sub_trainSet.
  3. store all dataSet in local folders.
  
- store_to_local.m: to store datastore to local folders.

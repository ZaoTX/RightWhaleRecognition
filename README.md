# RightWhaleRecognition

## Preprocessing
- readData.m : the first file to read images according to train.csv and categorized images into different subfolders according to labels.

### For recognition

- gTruth.mat: ROIs generated by image labeler.

- crop.m : load 'gTruth.mat', change path, and crop whale head according to ROI.

- divide_n_oversampling.m: 
  1. divide dataSet into testSet, sub_validationSet, sub_trainSet 
  2. oversampling by creating 9 copies of each image in sub_trainSet.
  3. store all dataSet in local folders.
  
- store_to_local.m: to store datastore to local folders.

## Detection

- cascadeObjectDetection.m: This file makes 'trained_model.xml' file which is used as detector.

- trained_model.xml: Detector file made by cascadeObjectDetection.m.

- detection_performance.m: 
  1. Set folder that contains images to detect(Folder name need to be modified with user's folder name)
  2. Control image size using loop statement considering the number of detected parts
  3. Store the detected part using imwrite function.
